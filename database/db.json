Using the path of the robe when the servo rotates clockwise the curtain closes, and the same at the counter-clockwise direction the curtain opens.",

These sensors continuously track soil moisture, and when levels fall, they precisely start watering. The system also makes use of photoresistors to measure ambient light levels. An array of LEDs turns on in reaction to less sunshine, supplying crops with necessary illumination and providing a visible indicator of the health of the ecosystem. Intelligent lighting and sensor-driven irrigation have been combined in a novel way that could lead to sustainable interplanetary agriculture.",
